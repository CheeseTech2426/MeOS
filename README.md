# MeOS
MeOS is an operating system made in C# using the COSMOS Framework. All the graphics are powered by MeTGL
You can use this freely. This is just a hobby project.

# MeOS 2.0
Because I swapped Userkit to Devkit so I can get CosmosHTTP and CosmosCoroutines, unfortunally the MeOS 1.0 project doesn't work really well and I have to rewrite the OS. So MeOS 2.0 will seem a bit different and it will be delayed. I apologize the inconviniance.
